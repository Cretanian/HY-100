As you know, Im quite keen of comic books, especially the ones about superheroes. I find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating. Take my favorite superhero; Superman, not a great comic book, not particularly welldrawn, but the mythology; the mythology is not only great, its unique. Now, the staple of the superhero mythology is; there is the superhero and there is the alter ego. Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, Spiderman is actually Peter Parker; when that character wakes up in the morning, hes Peter Parker. He has to put on a costume to become Spiderman and it is in that characteristic, Superman stands alone.
