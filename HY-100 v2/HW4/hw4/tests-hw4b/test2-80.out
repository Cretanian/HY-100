  These events happened to me about 4 years ago when spent a year working at one
                                           of the largest theme parks in the UK.
     This place is about half an hour from where I live and while I wont name it
                            directly Im sure a few of you can guess where it is.
       I worked there as a ride assistant, and worked on several different rides
                 including 3 of the big coasters and a couple of the dark rides.
      For those who dont know a dark ride is basically a ride that is completely
                                                                        indoors.
                    The most common example of this is your typical ghost train.
   Now one particular ride is based partly inside the ruins of the family estate
                                              from which the park gets its name.
The ride tells a pretty well known local story about the family that used to own
                  the estate and a supposed curse that they were afflicted with.
   The ride would start with an indoor queuing area, before moving guests into a
  cinema which told them the story and then to a place known as the Octagon room
                                 where there would be a small effect based show.
  Then finally guests would unknowingly exit the ruins and board the actual ride
                                          which was a haunted swing type affair.
   The actual ruins are well known for being potentially haunted with programmes
   such as Most Haunted featuring them, and after my time on that ride I can 100
                                                                          agree.
   One night during October, which is when the park stays open till 9pm to allow
             guests to ride in the dark, I was sat at the end of the queue line.
    A member of staff is always stationed here to ensure that there a) arent too
                           many people in each group and b) to greet the guests.
      Now usually after about 5pm the ride became pretty deserted as most people
wanted to ride the roller coasters in the dark, not walk through some very dimly
                                         lit building so my job was really easy.
 At the end of the queue line there was a small station with a television screen
     showing security camera feeds and a direct phone line to the ride operators
                                                                          cabin.
      The cameras focused on the outdoor entrance, the entire queue line and the
                cinema area, there werent any blind spots either on these feeds.
     Now this night I was doing my usual thing, checking Facebook, playing angry
    birds and keeping one eye on the monitor when I spotted what I guessed was a
       young couple making their way up the winding queue, zig zagging their way
                                                                     towards me.
 I locked my phone and shoved it in my pocket as sometimes the managers liked to
                                                          try to sneak up on us.
As the couple got about 3 quarters of the way to me I turned around to give them
   a friendly wave and to assure them that the ride was still open and that they
                                             would have the place to themselves.
  They were gone, I stood staring for a moment in complete puzzlement, there was
   no way that they could have ran out of the room without either opening one of
  the loud heavy firedoors or jumping over about 20 sets of metal bars that made
                                                                   up the queue.
As my brain processed this information the hairs on the back of my neck rose and
    a sudden chill ran through my very core, needless to say I was very relieved
   when a coworker came about ten minutes later so that I could go for my break.
  While that was an isolated incident, the next thing happened several times but
     never really phased me, throughout my life I have had a fair few paranormal
encounters and have a certain sense for when something is around, and whether it
                                                               is malign or not.
  In the building the Octagon room was the last section of the ruins that guests
 passed through and believe it or not was a fairly large octagon shaped chamber.
      Usually after the show finishes a thick, heavy curtain is pulled back by a
                      machine to reveal a secret tunnel that guests must follow.
    About 4 months into the season this machine broke, and the maintenance staff
    realised that the part they needed wouldnt be available until after the park
    closed in November, so rather than pinning back the curtain the decision was
      made that one ride assistant would have the fun job of standing behind the
  curtain in the pitch black and once each show had finished they would pull the
       curtain and allow the guests to pass through, making sure nobody was left
                                                                         behind.
   More often than not, this duty fell to me, I enjoyed my time sat in the dark,
  after a week or two I knew the exact timings of all the light and sound queues
 of the show and also scared quite a few people who werent expecting some guy to
be stood behind this mysterious curtain, in fact many people thought I was a wax
 statue and I would play on this before moving slightly whenever they went in to
                                                       take a closer look at me.
 However, every so often I would get an immense oppressive feeling wash over me,
    the room would feel much darker than it had a couple of seconds before and I
       would always get the distinct impression that there was some sort of male
                                                        presence just behind me.
      Although I never turned around once, I always stood my ground, I knew this
     presence did not want me or anybody else there in his area and he made that
                                     quite clear to many other members of staff.
   There were several reports of female coworkers being pushed from behind while
                                          working in that area and even pinched.
 The frequency and nature of this presence soon meant that I was one of the only
 people who were willing to stand there and endure the intense feeling of hatred
 that would randomly appear and disappear, all the while hearing an endless loop
                     of some old hag cackling and whispering curses, I loved it.
