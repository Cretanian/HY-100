I had not been pulling for more than a minute or so, when George noticed something black floating on the water, and we drew
                                                                                                                  up to it.
                                                                   George leant over, as we neared it, and laid hold of it.
                                                                     And then he drew back with a cry, and a blanched face.
                                                                                           It was the dead body of a woman.
                                                         It lay very lightly on the water, and the face was sweet and calm.
     It was not a beautiful face; it was too prematurely aged looking, too thin and drawn, to be that; but it was a gentle,
     lovable face, in spite of its stamp of pinch and poverty, and upon it was that look of restful peace that comes to the
                                                           faces of the sick sometimes when at last the pain has left them.
